# Smart-Farming
1. Conceived, designed, and executed an innovative IoT-based smart farming system that leverages dedicated 4G connectivity to
revolutionize agricultural practices. The project aimed to optimize farming processes by harnessing data-driven insights and
automation, all without relying on traditional Wi-Fi connections.
2. Used Blynk/Thingspeak at the start for testing,planned to use AWS cloud with Kodular app.
3. Getting Realtime data on Blynk app and serial mointor, with sms alert, can make call us AT commands.

Features :
1. VVM ESP32 4G LTE Module is an ultra-low power embedded SoC designed for high-speed wireless communication. It integrates the latest LTE module standards and provides a host of features such as advanced modulation and coding technologies, flexible antenna configurations, and high-speed radio transmission.
2. Easy migration from 2G/3G network to 4G network now made possible using this module. Network providers are in the process of shutting down support for 2G /3G and businesses relying on wireless communication are hurrying to transition to 4G LTE connectivity. Legacy devices still relying on 2G/3G can be upgraded to 4G networks and made IoT/ Industry 4.0 ready.
ESP-WROOM-32 30 PIN Development Board which has a dual 32-bit CPU is coupled with 4G LTE wireless communication module SIM7670C
3. The module uses one of the popular 4G LTE chipset A7670C by SIMCOM. The SIM7670C is Multi-Band LTE-TDD/LTE-FDD/HSPA+ and GSM/GPRS/EDGE module solution in an SMT type which supports LTE CAT1 up to 10Mbps for download data transfer
4. The preconfigured AT commands of A7670C makes it easier for the user to communicate via MQTT, SMS, Calls etc.
5. ESP32-WROOM-32 is a powerful, generic Wi-Fi + Bluetooth + Bluetooth LE MCU module that targets a wide variety of applications, ranging from low-power sensor networks to the most demanding tasks, such as IoT applications, voice encoding, music streaming and MP3 decoding.
6. Indian 4G bands can be used with this module. This means it can be used with Jio, Airtel, Vodafone networks, etc.
7. The board supports multiple built-in network protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, MQTT along with SMS and calls
8. The board is powered using a Type- C connector and requires a regulated 5V/2A power source
9. On-board fuse protection, transient voltage protection and EMI suppression
10. VVM LTE 4G module come with antennas that allow for better reception and faster data speeds.
11. Automatic switchover to 2G/EDGE in absence of LTE.
12. On-board USB connector, SIM card connector, antenna connector and additional PCB connector for User Interface

Applications :
Supports multiple network bands and can be used in a variety of applications including IoT applications, Telematics, Surveillance Devices, PoS, Industrial Routers, Remote Diagnostics, MQTT gateways, etc. Legacy devices still relying on 2G/3G can be upgraded to 4G networks and made IoT/ Industry 4.0 ready.
